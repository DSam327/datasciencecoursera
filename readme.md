The objective of the project is to create a clean and tidy dataset, which will be stored in a Github repository along with the R script used to perform the analysis. The repository will include a CodeBook.md file that outlines the variables, the dataset, and any steps taken to clean and transform the data. Additionally, a README.md file will be provided to explain the structure of the repository, detailing how the scripts work and their interconnections. This will offer clarity on the data processing and analysis workflow, making it easier to understand and replicate.
